## Information

**Background**

During the 20s in the United States, a law was approved that strictly prohibited the consumption, sell, buy and transport of any type of alcoholic beverage. It was called the DRY LAW.

in the big cities, where alcohol was consumed, people started to despair in the lack of their used drinks. Like any crisis, it meant despair for some and opportunity for others. That&#39;s when you, a famous mafia member got a glance of what may be the new golden apple tree. Around the cities, special places where built with secret rooms and bars where people could attend to get some family time, some food, and with a little bit of luck a glass of their favorite cocktail.

Law enforcers like coops patrol the areas and restaurants in the look for illegal places where their fellow country members are being presented with unauthorized substances that may cause harm to the population, alcoholic drinks.

You as a skilled and patient businessman control a newly opened restaurant in town, and you believe, that for a fair amount of cash, everyone deserves to enjoy the possibilities of a fair drink.

Be sure to balance your numbers to open a new clandestine bar and a beautiful restaurant to cover the place. Raise your popularity with your selected clientele to take control over the city, be careful not to raise the attention of the cops that may cause you financial problems.

**The local**

The player must manage the 3 main areas of the newly opened placed.

1. The Restaurant: The Place where food is served and prepared, the Place where every client comes alone or with someone to take their time and enjoy a good meal
2. The Bar: a secret entrance from the restaurant leads to the hidden place where at night customers can enjoy a good drink, for a high amount of cash
3. The Cargo: the place where shipments of food, drinks and alcohol is received from behind. This room will store your good for your needs.

**Main Archetypes**

1. Mafia Members: mafia members will work as the personnel for your daily restaurant. They will take care of the client&#39;s orders and food, and if anything happens, they will take care of the local security. Mafia members will divide to take and attend the bar the Cargo and the restaurant.
2. The costumers: the customer is always right, either if they want pasta or a martini. They will come at all hours asking for a good and quality service. Some clients will ask for food, others for special drinks during the night, or maybe both. Be sure to stay stocked of items or they will leave with bad experience decreasing your local popularity.
3. The cops: they will patrol the area and enter the restaurant to check if everything is in order. They may even look at your cargo dock. Be careful not to raise their alertness level or they might discover your true business. If they found out your deal a battle may take place and bad things can happen. More cops, les popularity, more alertness, and worse, less money.

**Main Shift**

A Main shift is thought to be considered for the game.

A Day night cycle will change clients need and cops&#39; behaviors. Mafia members will divide their work.

During the **day** they will attend the restaurant and the cargo bay to stay stocked,

During the **night** , the restaurant will serve food and the bar will open their doors to the public.

**Manage your resources**

As the head of the mafia you should be able to maintain a fair balance between risk and profit. in order to accomplish your mission, you will take control of 3 main **consumable resources** :

1. Money: it will allow you to buy consumables such as food, drinks, alcohol, at the same time it can be used to buy, redesign or expand areas of your business to grow your capacity numbers. More people more money, right?
2. Food &amp; drinks: with money you will supply the enough need to maintain customer happy and satiated with their needs in the restaurant area. Be sure to keep your stocks high of groceries. Fill your deposit are with food and no one will be mad about your service.
3. Alcohol: your main business, it expensive to buy but sure it does pay your bills. Customers will pay a high amount of money to get their drinks. Keep your stocks high so you can see good amounts of cocktails during the night. Careful, you don&#39;t want to gain the cops attention with lots of alcohol in your cargo deposit area.

**Non-consumable resources** are also important to take your business to the next level. Take notice of popularity, to control the town. If you have the people you have the city.

1. Popularity: this bar will tell you how amazing your place is, people will start talking about you. That&#39;s good and bad news. The good, more consumers will keep coming, which means more money, the bad, alertness level will rise, calling cops more often to check on your store, but sure you can handle it. When popularity stats raise to maximum a huge amount of client will come, consume and tip a great amount of money before dropping the bar down to 0.

**Money related upgrades:**

With some money at hand you can decide where to invest

Invest to expand your:

- Bar: likewise, more capacity will give you higher incomes, and alcohol gets you more money that normal food. Sure, luxury is expensive. 


**Objective:**

Your main task is to fill the City Control Meter, which will indicate you how close or far you are in taking control of the city.

The City Control Meter will rise when customers satisfaction rises, and as you gain popularity and more clients come it will fill up quicker.

The bar will go down if something drastic happens with the cops or client satisfaction goes to critical levels.

Lastly be sure not to go bankrupt, if you have no resources your city control meter will go down and you may lose control of your own mafia. That&#39;s a game over.
