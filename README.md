# Kind of a Business



**Background**

During the 20s in the United States, a law was approved that strictly prohibited the consumption, sell, buy and transport of any type of alcoholic beverage. It was called the DRY LAW.

in the big cities, where alcohol was consumed, people started to despair in the lack of their used drinks. Like any crisis, it meant despair for some and opportunity for others. That&#39;s when you, a famous mafia member got a glance of what may be the new golden apple tree. Around the cities, special places where built with secret rooms and bars where people could attend to get some family time, some food, and with a little bit of luck a glass of their favorite cocktail.

Law enforcers like coops patrol the areas and restaurants in the look for illegal places where their fellow country members are being presented with unauthorized substances that may cause harm to the population, alcoholic drinks.

You as a skilled and patient businessman control a newly opened restaurant in town, and you believe, that for a fair amount of cash, everyone deserves to enjoy the possibilities of a fair drink.

Be sure to balance your numbers to open a new clandestine bar and a beautiful restaurant to cover the place. Raise your popularity with your selected clientele to take control over the city, be careful not to raise the attention of the cops that may cause you financial problems.

**The local**

The player must manage the 3 main areas of the newly opened placed.

1. The Restaurant: The Place where food is served and prepared, the Place where every client comes alone or with someone to take their time and enjoy a good meal
2. The Bar: a secret entrance from the restaurant leads to the hidden place where at night customers can enjoy a good drink, for a high amount of cash
3. The Cargo: the place where shipments of food, drinks and alcohol is received from behind. This room will store your good for your needs. If any issue happens with the cops, you will know where to get rid of the bodies.

**Main Archetypes**

1. Mafia Members: mafia members will work as the personnel for your daily restaurant. They will take care of the client&#39;s orders and food, and if anything happens, they will take care of the local security. Mafia members will divide to take and attend the bar the Cargo and the restaurant.
2. The costumers: the customer is always right, either if they want pasta or a martini. They will come at all hours asking for a good and quality service. Some clients will ask for food, others for special drinks during the night, or maybe both. Be sure to stay stocked of items or they will leave with bad experience decreasing your local popularity.
3. The cops: they will patrol the area and enter the restaurant to check if everything is in order. They may even look at your cargo dock. Be careful not to raise their alertness level or they might discover your true business. If they found out your deal a battle may take place and bad things can happen. More cops, les popularity, more alertness, and worse, less money.

**Main Shift**

A Main shift is thought to be considered for the game.

A Day night cycle will change clients need and cops&#39; behaviors. Mafia members will divide their work.

During the **day** they will attend the restaurant and the cargo bay to stay stocked,

During the **night** , the restaurant will serve food and the bar will open their doors to the public.

**Manage your resources**

As the head of the mafia you should be able to maintain a fair balance between risk and profit. in order to accomplish your mission, you will take control of 3 main **consumable resources** :

1. Money: it will allow you to buy consumables such as food, drinks, alcohol, at the same time it can be used to buy, redesign or expand areas of your business to grow your capacity numbers. More people more money, right?
2. Food &amp; drinks: with money you will supply the enough need to maintain customer happy and satiated with their needs in the restaurant area. Be sure to keep your stocks high of groceries. Fill your deposit are with food and no one will be mad about your service.
3. Alcohol: your main business, it expensive to buy but sure it does pay your bills. Customers will pay a high amount of money to get their drinks. Keep your stocks high so you can see good amounts of cocktails during the night. Careful, you don&#39;t want to gain the cops attention with lots of alcohol in your cargo deposit area.

**Non-consumable resources** are also important to take your business to the next level. Take notice of popularity, alertness and satisfaction to control the town. If you have the people you have the city.

1. Popularity: this bar will tell you how amazing your place is, people will start talking about you. That&#39;s good and bad news. The good, more consumers will keep coming, which means more money, the bad, alertness level will rise, calling cops more often to check on your store, but sure you can handle it. When popularity stats raise to maximum a huge amount of client will come, consume and tip a great amount of money before dropping the bar down to 0.
2. Alertness: this measurement will keep you updated in the police interest in your place. The higher it gets the more frequent policeman will come to look and more time they will take inspecting your local.  When alertness stats full be careful with a full cop&#39;s operation where they will check the place looking for illegal alcohol, if you pass the challenge alertness will drop down and client satisfaction will go up.
3. Average client satisfaction: these clients just want two things. They want to enjoy their meals or drinks and a secure place with security to drink in peace. Customers will leave with a positive or negative impact toward your place based on both of those factors. Depending on the average satisfaction level your popularity bar will go up and down. Avoid police combat and serve the drinks, that&#39;s all they want.

**Money related upgrades:**

With some money at hand you can decide where to invest

Invest to expand your:

- Restaurant to be able to take a greater number of clients at the same time. more capacity higher income rate. However legal money comes with taxes you will have to pay eventually. !?(maybe an option to not pay taxes but increment the Alertness)

- Bar: likewise, more capacity will give you higher incomes, and alcohol gets you more money that normal food. Sure, luxury is expensive. This will help you earn more money that you will not have to pay taxes. Be sure to protect your area, if anything happens more people will be affected, and popularity and satisfaction will go down.
- Cargo &amp; deposit: your storage capacity will be higher, so you can have more food, drinks and alcohol. This way it&#39;s easier not to have shortage of products and have better satisfaction levels

Also, you may be able to pay for more personal and **hire mafia members,** helping you speed up the work and have some extra guns if the police come to your place and found out about your business.



**Objective:**

Your main task is to fill the City Control Meter, which will indicate you how close or far you are in taking control of the city.

The City Control Meter will rise when customers satisfaction rises, and as you gain popularity and more clients come it will fill up quicker.

The bar will go down if something drastic happens with the cops or client satisfaction goes to critical levels.

Lastly be sure not to go bankrupt, if you have no resources your city control meter will go down and you may lose control of your own mafia. That&#39;s a game over.

How to achieve your goal?

Quick follow tips of fellow mafia member are:

- Open, create or upgrade places: this will give you a boost, augmenting your popularity levels and give you more capacity for either food or clients.
- Upgrade your staff: every time you hire new workers, the productivity of your local will go up, and being able to attend more customers and achieve a higher security attracts more clients.

**Archetypes interactions:**

Knowing how things will come up will help you build a better place.

Interaction between different personal may be:

1. Staff and Police: if policemen found about your alcohol issue a battle will begin. this means your popularity levels will go down, customers do not like conflict, and less with fire guns.

Depending on the outcome, there are 2 possibilities. You either win: defeat all the cops and lead them to the cargo where you will get rid of them, and your alertness level goes down. Or you are defeated, where the cops will confiscate the alcohol and make you pay a fee. This will lower your popularity further and increase the alertness level.

1. Staff and Consumer:  Consumers will have their food and pay the price, but sometimes, a smart one will try to go free of charges. When a robbery takes place, your staff will try to get the burglar and stop him.

If he goes away, popularity decreases, and alertness increases. If he is caught, popularity increases and alertness level decreases. Thanks to you, and the nice security.

1. (NEW) Consumer and Police: as the last case if there is a robbery and a police officer is there, it will act to defend the local business. Consequences are the same rewarding popularity, but alertness levels will go up in either case.

**Routines:**

Staff:

During the day the default action will be to walk around waiting for consumers to order some food. In case they order, look for it and give it to them.

If a cargo shipment comes, they will divide, and some kill take the goods and restock.

Whenever a cop is found try to hide the alcohol and get it to the close bar.

If police found the alcohol, they will try to kill the cop and get rid of him/them.

when a customer tries to steal, all stop what they are doing and go after him to stop it, closing the door if nearby.

During the night the cargo deposit closes the activity and the bar opens.

Restaurant activity stays the same. Now staff members divide to take care of the restaurant and the bar. Taking the orders of the different members.

some of the will patrol the area in looking for cops, if the find one they will warn the others and close the bar until the cops are out of place.

Police: Policemen will patrol the area looking for alcohol or the bar. The main difference during the day and night shift is that when the sun is out, they will look at the restaurant and the open deposit cargo, and during the night they will look at the restaurant and the bar if the found it open. During the night they may also stay longer giving some rounds in the restaurant.

If they found a customer leaving without paying, they will try to apprehend it.

Customer:

During the day and Night both they will order some food and walk around the area, go in and out of the place.

Some may trigger a low probability that will make them try to leave without paying and they will try to run away.

During the night the clients will ask for food, drink or both, trying to look for the bar is the gate is opened, and stay there for a while consuming drinks.



**Game Design elements:**

Feedback element: with the purpose of giving feedback to the player of what is happening inside the behavior of each NPC text bubbles are thought to be implemented that will show an icon that tells the player what is passing through the mind of each character. The bubble must appear and disappear with different intervals depending on the impact on the action the player needs to take. For example, a quick bubble may appear for a customer ordering food. And for a cop looking for suspicious activity the bubble will stay longer and call for the players attention.

Newspaper element: A Newspaper in thought to be a good idea to lead the player each new day, appearing in the front of the screen and having a huge headline telling how good or bad is the business performing, and how the cops are interested, or not, in the place.

Taxes: ate the same time taxes should be paid daily for money legally made, forcing the player to have bar activity to have better incomes and go forward in the City Control Meter.

**Game design note:** having only a restaurant must be balanced, for it not to be able to progress in the game, forcing the player to open a bar to gain higher profits and invest in more things. The player must not be able to win with no bar.
